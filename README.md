## 📥 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A fresh installation of **Windows 10/11** or **Ubuntu/Debian Linux**
- **Git** installed on your system
- Administrative privileges on your machine

### 🪟 Windows (Host & WSL 2)

The Windows script is your main entry point and automatically triggers WSL setup.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reireymond/ESSENTIALSPPACK
cd ESSENTIALSPPACK
```

**Step 2: Execute the Setup Script**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator (the script will handle elevation via 'gsudo' if available)
cd Windows
.\setup_windows.ps1

# Optional: Specify a different WSL distribution
cd Windows
.\setup_windows.ps1 -WslDistro Debian
```

**Step 3: Follow the Prompts**
- The script will install WSL if needed (may require a system reboot)
- You'll be prompted for your **Linux (sudo) password** to execute the WSL setup script (`wsl_ubuntu.sh`)
- Sit back and watch the magic happen! ☕

### 🐧 Linux (Native - Debian/Ubuntu)

For native Linux environments, use the dedicated setup script.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reireymond/ESSENTIALSPPACK
cd ESSENTIALSPPACK
```

**Step 2: Make the Script Executable and Run**
```bash
cd Linux
chmod +x setup_linux.sh
sudo ./setup_linux.sh
```

**Step 3: Wait for Completion**
- The script will automatically handle all installations
- Review the summary at the end to see what was installed successfully

## ⚙️ Package Configuration

**New in v5.0:** JSON-based configuration makes package management a breeze!

### 📄 `packages_windows.json`

Organizes all Windows packages by package manager:
- **winget**: Preferred installation method (Windows Package Manager)
- **choco**: Fallback or exclusive packages (Chocolatey)

**Example - Adding/Removing Packages:**
```json
{
  "winget": [
    "Microsoft.VisualStudioCode",
    "Git.Git",
    "RARLab.WinRAR"
  ],
  "choco": [
    "neovim",
    "7zip",
    "hxd"
  ]
}
```

### 📄 `packages_linux.json`

Organizes all Linux packages by installation method:
- **apt**: System packages (apt-get)
- **snap**: Snap packages
- **pip**: Python tools (installed via pipx)
- **git**: Git repositories to clone

**Example - Adding/Removing Packages:**
```json
{
  "apt": ["zsh", "nmap", "docker-ce"],
  "snap": ["kubectl"],
  "pip": ["pwntools", "semgrep"],
  "git": {
    "seclists": "https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** - Just edit JSON files, no script modification needed
- ✅ **Clear organization** - Packages grouped by installation method
- ✅ **Version control friendly** - Track changes easily in Git
- ✅ **No coding required** - Simple JSON syntax anyone can edit
